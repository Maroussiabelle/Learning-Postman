# Postman Collection: CRUD Operations Practice

## Introduction



This Postman collection has been created for educational purposes to provide hands-on practice in writing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) methods. The API used for this practice is Dummy API, a mock API designed for learning and testing.

### Writing Tests

Each request in the collection is accompanied by JavaScript tests written with Postman Snippets. These tests showcase how to perform basic assertions and validations. You can review the tests in the "Tests" tab of each request to understand their functionality.

This collection is purely for educational purposes and uses Dummy API to simulate a real-world API.
